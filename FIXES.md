## Custom content

| Area | Change | Issue | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom hats | Custom hat pipeline (client hooks, client tools patcher, `tools/custom-items` scripts). Game assets are not committed. | [#9](https://github.com/dkgigantone/ro3emu-plus/issues/9) | `custom-hats` | Work in progress, no pull request yet |

## Investigated, no change needed

| Report | Finding |
|---|---|
| Madogear Pilot does nothing | Works as designed: the mount is started with the HUD mount button. |
| Merchant NPCs (Milk, Fruit, Shrimp, ...) do not open a shop | The client data gives them a single dialogue line and no shop action; only the Novice Shop NPC, Kafra and the Equipment Merchant open a shop. Behavior of the original game is not verified. |
| Frost Diver level 10 rarely freezes | Matches the skill data: 10% chance, 1 second. |
